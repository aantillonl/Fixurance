# Fixurance - OTSO CodeCamp
Project for Code camp at Lappeenranta University of Technology. The code camp is an intensive course that lasts 5 days,
in those 5 days a team has to develop a working application using the technology studied in the codecamp and to solve a 
particular problem

This codec camp was carried out in collaboration with the company OTSO, a large insurance company in Finland.
The goal of the code camp was to develop an application for a windows tablet to assist insurance sales representatives
in providing rapid quotes on multiple insurance packages for potential customers and collect contact information.

The focus of the application was to maximize usability and simplicity of the process, to enable a sales representative to
promote insurance products in a crowded environment, for example a mall or an event.
